## Description

We have intercepted a message from the enemy, but that's weird, it doesn't make any sense. They won't just sit and wait will they?


## Write up

Openning the pdf file we find a normal message, the secret here is to find the hidden message (the text was written in white) we clearly see it's a substitution cipher, after some frequency analysis on the characters we'll get the flag, we can use [this](https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution) website to decrypt it.
