Starting with the title which is the hardest part in the challenge, playing with it a little bit we can kinda guess "Esi class", since we are hosting the event in SBA, we know it's ESI SBA.<br>
Now to the description "you can find anything online", we can guess either the school site, social media ... or just simply **search** it in google.<br>
let's go to the photos section, we can see a photo inside a class, in the board we see a QR code, let's scan it.<br>
and there you go: `AlphaCTF{1M_7oO_CO0l_f0R_SCHo0l}`
